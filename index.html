    <h1>Privacy Policy for KAI</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> September 7, 2025</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>KAI is a personal finance assistant designed with privacy as a core principle. 
    The app helps you track expenses by analyzing financial SMS messages on your device and allowing you to add manual transactions with the help of an on-device AI model. 
    Your data always stays on your device and is never sent to external servers.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>SMS Messages:</strong> KAI reads SMS messages only to detect financial transactions (such as bank alerts, UPI, or card transactions). Non-financial messages are ignored.</li>
      <li><strong>Manual Input:</strong> If you choose to enter a transaction manually, the input is processed locally using a small on-device AI model to extract structured information (amount, type, merchant, etc.).</li>
      <li><strong>App Settings:</strong> Certain preferences and metadata (like the date of the last processed message) are stored locally to improve efficiency.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use the Information</h2>
    <p>
      - SMS messages are processed <strong>locally</strong> to extract and categorize financial transactions.<br/>
      - Manual entries are parsed locally with AI (via the <em>Cactus</em> engine + GGUF model).<br/>
      - Parsed data is stored in a local SQLite database on your device.<br/>
      - No personal or financial information is uploaded, shared, or transmitted to any server.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>All SMS messages, parsed transactions, and app settings are stored locally on your device. 
    The app does not create or use any online database or cloud storage. You may clear this data at any time by uninstalling the app or clearing its app data.</p>

    <h2>Permissions Used</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>READ_SMS & RECEIVE_SMS:</strong> Required to read transaction SMS for expense tracking.</li>
      <li><strong>INTERNET & ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE:</strong> Used only for downloading AI model files or app updates. No personal data is transmitted online.</li>
      <li><strong>WAKE_LOCK:</strong> Ensures expense tracking and background operations work reliably.</li>
      <li><strong>REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS:</strong> Keeps SMS processing and notifications active in the background.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>AI and Cactus Integration</h2>
    <p>
      KAI includes a lightweight on-device AI assistant powered by <em>Cactus</em> and a small GGUF model. 
      The AI runs entirely on your phone to help parse manual entries. No SMS or personal data is uploaded to remote servers as part of this process.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Sharing</h2>
    <p>KAI does not share, sell, or transfer your personal or financial data to any third parties.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>Your data remains on your device at all times. 
    For additional security, you can use your deviceâ€™s built-in protections (PIN, fingerprint, encryption, etc.).</p>

    <h2>Your Control</h2>
    <p>
      - You may deny SMS permissions, but core expense tracking features will be limited.<br/>
      - You may clear or delete all local data at any time by uninstalling the app.<br/>
      - No data is retained by the developer once the app is removed from your device.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to this Policy</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. 
    Any changes will be reflected in the app and on the published Privacy Policy URL.</p>

    <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us at:</p>
