    <p>You can permanently delete all your data by:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Uninstalling the KAI app from your device</li>
      <li>Or, clearing the app's storage and cache from your device settings</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Types of Data Deleted</h2>
    <p>When you uninstall or clear storage, the following data is deleted immediately:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>All SMS transaction records processed by the app</li>
      <li>All manually added expense entries</li>
      <li>All app settings and preferences</li>
    </ul>
